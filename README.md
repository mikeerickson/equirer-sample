# Test Enquirer

This is a very crude example of what I am trying to acocmplish.

The only way I can reallly get what I am looking for is to nest the various input requests into the `then` phase of each promise.

I am simulating the `fname`, `lname` and `email` inputs into variables, however, the actual input requests will vary depending if the user has supplied these values in previous attempts

You can get a feel for what I am trying to do by adding values to the `fname`, `lname` and email fields.

Let me know if you have further questions on what I am trying to acocmplish
